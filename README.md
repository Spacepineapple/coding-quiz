This project was completed by myself -- Neal Reeves. The content contained in
the logic.js and scores.js files was written entirely by myself. However, this
project also used starter code provided by edX as part of their Front End Web
Development bootcamp. This included the contents of the index.html,
highscores.html and styles.css files.
